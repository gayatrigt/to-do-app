The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so all the components (Header.tsx, Footer.tsx, index.tsx, _app.tsx, _document.tsx) will use React for defining components and managing state.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience. The tsconfig.json file is the configuration file for TypeScript.

4. **CSS Modules**: The CSS Modules methodology is used in the Home.module.css file and is likely used in other component-specific CSS files. This allows for CSS to be scoped to specific components, reducing the risk of style conflicts across the application.

5. **Global CSS**: The globals.css file contains styles that are applied across the entire application. These styles are likely imported in the _app.tsx file, which wraps all pages in the application.

6. **Public Assets**: The favicon.ico and vercel.svg files are static assets stored in the public directory. These files are likely referenced in the _document.tsx file, which is responsible for rendering the HTML structure of the application.

7. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts, which are shared across the entire project.

8. **.next/config.js**: This file contains configuration for the Next.js application, which is shared across the entire project.

Note: Without specific code examples, it's not possible to provide details on exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names.
